              Our store is hosted online. They provide us with the online
              e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and
              services to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your data is stored through Boot It’s data storage, databases and
              the general shopping application. They store your data on a secure
              server behind a firewall.

            <p class="text-secondary font-semibold">Payment:</p>
            <p>
              If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase,
              then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through
              the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your
              purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary
              to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete,
              your purchase transaction information is deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
              All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS
              as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
              effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
              Discover.
            </p>
            <p>
              PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit
              card information by our store and its service providers.

            SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
          </h2>
          <div className="text-white text-sm space-y-3 mt-4">
            <p>
              In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
              collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary
              to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
              gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own
              privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
              provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
              policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal
              information will be handled by these providers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in
              or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction
              than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
              transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
              provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of
              the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
              facilities are located.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction
              is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States,
              then your personal information used in completing that transaction
              may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation,
              including the Patriot Act.
            </p>
