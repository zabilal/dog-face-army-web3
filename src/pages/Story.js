            the dogface Army story

          <p className="text-sm text-white text-justify mt-4  font-Opensans leading-7">
            The Xeno invaded Earth, destroying the planet’s military bases. An
            immediate counter attack failed, leaving the remaining survivors
            with no choice but to flee to the fringes of the globe in search of
            asylum. Cities became battlefields, jungles became hideouts, deserts
            became landing bays, and arctic regions became home to the
            resistance. The resistance gave birth to a community of ‘Dogface’
            soldiers - everyone in it to fight for a better future.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-white text-justify mt-4  font-Opensans leading-7">
            The collective Dogface soldiers, out of desperation, had one last
            plan: a mission to fight back the Xeno and reclaim the lands and to
            bring aid to the retired veterans that had gotten us this far. It
            would involve the Dogface soldiers entering the ‘no man’s land’ to
            retrieve DNA of past war heroes from relics within the city. The DNA
            collected will be used to mass clone a new type of soldier, built
            for the war at hand, a Dogface army of 5,555 soldiers to fight in:
            urban, jungle, desert, and arctic regions. Each region has its own
            rarity.
